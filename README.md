## Why

I wanted a config that was truly mine and that would help me be fast and accurate
in coding.

Neovim configurations are really personal. 
I hope that this repository will be a source of inspiration for you.

This configuration is intended to be used primarily with:

- Django
- Pelican
- TailwindCSS

I will add specific support to other technologies.

## Install

Create a virtual environment

`python3 -m venv ~/.config/nvim/venv`

Install `pynvim`

`~/.config/nvim/venv/bin/pip install pynvim`

## Usage

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/lcfd/NaryaVim/wiki).

## Neovim version

I'm using this configuration in Neovim `0.8`.
