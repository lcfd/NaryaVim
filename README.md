</div>

## Why

I wanted a config that was truly mine and that would help me be fast and accurate
in coding.

Neovim configurations are really personal. 
I hope that this repository will be a source of inspiration for you.

This configuration is intended to be used primarily with:

- Django
- Pelican
- TailwindCSS

I will add specific support to other technologies.

## Usage

The most important thing to know is that the leader key is the space key.
